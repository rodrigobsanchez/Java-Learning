INSTANCE METHODS -> have to instantiate the class first (mean using the word 'new'.

STATIC VARIABLES --> also knowas as 'static member variable'
    ** Very useful for Scanner...declare scanner as static variable. Means all statc methods can access directly.

    Example> there is a dog name String and static... the las change you make for that String will change the name of all Objects of class Dog.
